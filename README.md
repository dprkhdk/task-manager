# 📝 Task Manager

A simple, responsive task manager built with **React** and **Material UI (MUI)**. This project allows users to filter tasks by **status**, **priority**, and **due date (today only)**. Tasks are displayed in a clean grid layout with visual indicators for priority and status.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Filter tasks by:
  - Status: Done, In Progress, Not Started
  - Priority: High, Medium, Low
  - Due Date: Only today
- 🎨 Responsive UI using MUI's `Box`, `Select`, `Typography`, and custom `Switch`
- 📅 Clean date formatting (e.g. `23 Jul 2025`)
- ✨ Color-coded priority and status badges
- 🛠️ Modular structure (separated `Task` component, types, filters)

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- React (with Hooks)
- TypeScript
- Material UI (v5)
- Custom Styled Components

P.S. still working on it 😅
